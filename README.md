# Udacity Advanced Machine Learning Nanodegree
All my projects completed as a part of the Nanodegree

## Projects
* Smartcab (Reinforcement Learning)
* CNN on CIFAR-10 using Tensorflow (Deep Learning)
* Capstone Project - CNN on Kaggle's Understanding Amazon from Space Dataset

### Smartcab
Using reinforcement techniques like Markov's Decision Process and Q-learning, writing code for a smartcab which moves from point to point with good safety and reliabiliy.
#### Software Requirements
* Python3
* Pygame
#### How to run it?
Navigate to [./smartcab]
```
python .\smartcab\agent.py

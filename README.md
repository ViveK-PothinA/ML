# Udacity Advanced Machine Learning Nanodegree
All my projects completed as a part of the Nanodegree

## Projects
* smartcab (Reinforcement Learning)
* image-classification : CNN on CIFAR-10 using Tensorflow (Deep Learning)
* capstone : Capstone Project - CNN on Kaggle's Understanding Amazon from Space Dataset

### Smartcab
Using reinforcement learning techniques like Markov's Decision Process and Q-learning, writing code for a smartcab which moves from point to point with good safety and reliabiliy.

#### Software Requirements
* Python3
* Pygame

Take a look at the [notebook](./smartcab/smartcab.ipynb) for more info!

### image-classification : CNN on CIFAR-10 using Tensorflow
Using [Tensorflow framework](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), built a CNN model which performs with 68% accuracy on [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10/data).

#### Software Requirements
* Python3
* Tensorflow
* Numpy
* cv2 (OpenCV)
* Matplotlib

Take a look at the [notebook](./image-classification/image_classification.ipynb) for more info!

### capstone : Capstone Project : CNN on Kaggle's Understanding Amazon from Space
[Understanding Amazon from Space](https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space/) is a competition on Kaggle. It is multi-label classification.
I used [Keras](https://keras.io/) to build my CNN model. My model achieved an accuracy of 90%.

#### Software Requirements
* Python3
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Numpy
* cv2 (OpenCV)
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
